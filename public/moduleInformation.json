In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent? of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel `power play,? market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand `what channels are for?? Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"BMA5009","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5524","ModuleTitle":"Applied Market Research","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleCredit":"4","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5525","ModuleTitle":"Competitive Strategies For Smes And Startups","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleCredit":"4","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Saturday Morning"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5531","ModuleTitle":"Sales Management","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleDescription":"This course systemically introduces sales management from process and procedure perspective.

Managing in the contemporary global economy is much more about managing networks than hierarchical organizations through fixed chains of command. Both within organizations and between them, the paths to productivity, innovation, and success lie in astute networking. Network management and leadership demand different capabilities from those necessary to run a single firm or division within it. Communication, persuasion, collaboration, negotiation, emotional intelligence, flexibility, trust-building, reciprocity, and responsiveness are all essential. However, good network management requires more than “soft” or interpersonal skills. Given the complexity of business networks today, familiarity with the technical tools of network analysis can be very helpful as well. A highly technical science of networks now exists. Managers should learn how to use that science in analyzing and engineering their networks for superior performance. We will approach the problem of managing networks from two perspectives, “up” and “down.” “Up” refers to your vantage point as an individual actor, crafting your personal network, positioning yourself within it, and leveraging it for professional advantage and success. “Down” is your vantage point as an executive charged with responsibility for the functioning and success of the network as a whole; for example, within a division or functional area or a supply chain or distribution system.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-4-3","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"BN2001","ModuleTitle":"Independent Study","Department":"Biomedical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module encourages students to become independent and self-motivated learners, and promote students interest in research-based work.

Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations.

Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0-4-4-0","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"Lecturers":["Sanjay Chaudhuri"],"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"FMS1204M","ModuleTitle":"FS: Appreciation of Basic Results in Mathematics","Department":"Mathematics","ModuleCredit":"4","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"Lecturers":["Koh Khee Meng"],"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"FMS1204P","ModuleTitle":"FS: Conceptual Development of Physics","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"The theme of this module is on the conceptual development of physics.

In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. On the other hand, probably all biological reactions occur in salty water. Water covers twothirds of our planet. At least to our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the ‘matrix of life’ which is not just a passive scaffold but also has many active roles in molecular biology. There are various scientific debates associated with water. For example, in the late 1960s, Russian chemist Boris Deryaguin and his colleagues claimed that polywater, a gel-like form of water, could be observed in small capillary tubes. Even more unbelievably, in the 1980s Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the ‘memory of water’, whereby the liquid water could allegedly be imprinted by biomolecular information which is now extensively used to justify homeopathy. In this module, we will explore how water, together with salts, shaped the emergence and evolution of life and also the students will have a full freedom to give your own opinions on the debates.

The carriage of goods by sea forms an important component of a wider body of law which is called maritime (or shipping) law. The subject matter of this course also forms a part of the (private) law of international trade and will assist those students studying international sales of goods and bank payment mechanisms in international trade, and insurance and marine insurance. All these subjects are invaluable to anyone who aspires eventually to work in shipping or international trade, whether as a lawyer in a law firm, as a legal adviser in-house, in insurance in a P & I Club, or for a marine insurer. Carriage of Goods by Sea is a core area of shipping law. The principal purpose which underlines this course is the carriage of cargo from one destination to another for profit. The seller/owner of goods who wishes to export them will hire a ship (particularly in the case of bulk commodities, such as oil) or space on a ship, depending on the quantity and type of goods to be transported. This course is therefore concerned with examining the legal relationships which arise between the shipper (or owner of the goods), the carrier (the shipowner), the charterer, and the receiver/consignee of the goods. The particular emphasis will be the principal documents of carriage, such as bills of lading, sea waybills and ship’s delivery orders, and the domestic legislation which governs these documents and also gives effect to international conventions. The coverage of international conventions will include the Rotterdam Rules, even though these Rules are not yet in force.

Do patterns of human behaviour discernable in primitive societies hold true in more complex ‘modern’ societies? What are the attributes of a ‘modern’ legal system?

In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing.

The new commitment of the co-habitation of nature and built environment has drawn attentions of the architects, urban designers and environmental professionals. The discourses of urban sustainability have to move away from social sufficiency, ecological efficiency to ecosystem compatibility by linking the forms and flows of urban, industrial and natural systems. The new challenges of urban ecological issue require design and environmental professionals to deal with how urban and environment spaces could be analyzed, designed, managed, evaluated, represented and changed for responding to the cutting-edge sustainable issues. Divided by two main categories, Spatial Typologies and Ecological Flows, the series of lecture covers the trends and issues of sustainable urban design and development. Following the introductory lecture based on planning and design history, the Part One Spatial Typologies includes global ecological effects of mega urban form, suburbanization and propositions of sustainable city, downtown urban design, waterfront revitalization and brown field redevelopment. The Part Two Ecological Flows covers the ecological design issues of landscape ecological flow, material and energy flow, water flow and informational flow. The sessions conclude with the discussion of representational dimension of urban and environmental design that is essential to the professional practices of ecologically sound urban and environmental design. By selecting one of the specific sustainable urban issues, students are required to work on a research project, which is to be presented as a team work during the semester and further developed as an individual term paper at the end of semester.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-4-3","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"UHB2204","ModuleTitle":"Virtue And Leadership","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module will examine the Biblical, Confucian, Socratic, and Modern or Machiavellian conceptions of the virtuous leader.

Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species.

Where did the ideas come from? Are they speculation or fact? How do we know? Of what use are they? How have they shaped our lives? In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein’s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton’s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (“moving clocks run slow”) is easily derived from Einstein’s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid’s space with Newton’s time. A further generalization leads to the General Theory of Relativity which shows gravity to be an effect of a dynamical curved spacetime, the framework for cosmology.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-0-3-3","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2015-04-28T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"UNL2206","ModuleTitle":"Nature's Threads","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module seeks to explore the importance of various key ideas in the history of physics by considering a selection of examples each semester as a means of examining the whys and hows of certain scientific revolutions.

How did it come to be a core principle in nation-building? What are state imperatives and social processes and state imperatives in its historical making and constant remaking? Why are race, language and religion its core constitutive elements and how have their saliency evolved over time? What are its main controversial features and areas of tensions, and how do these affect identities, social relations between individuals, groups and communities, and impact social cohesion, citizenship and belonging?

For Singapore, this question has been a key feature of its nation-building process since 1965 and its response has been the cultivation of an ostensibly ‘Asian’ multiculturalism styled in contradistinction to ‘Western’ liberal models. This module examines and evaluates the conceptual framework of the Singaporean model of multiculturalism. It does so by positioning it in relation to other existing theories of ethnocultural identity and rights. In so doing, it asks: 1. What are the theoretical and normative underpinnings of the Singaporean model? 2. How does it stand up against the liberal-democratic model? 3.

How has the state attempted to convey Asia as a natural and unproblematic an entity? How is knowledge about it influenced and conditioned by changing social, political, and economic forces? Why did Singapore at its earliest historical phase seek to dissociate itself with the region, only to openly embrace it a few decades later?

This multidisciplinary module emphasises both the empirical and the theoretical.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-0-6","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"USP3508","ModuleTitle":"The Politics of the Body","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"From the ‘Clean Hands” campaign to the heightened use of biometrics, the body has become a crucial site for political action, decision, and judgment. As a result, corporeal registers— facial expressions, phenotype, movement, affective expressions, etc.—are now vital markers of difference, determining the degree to which one is recognized as ‘friend’ or ‘enemy’, ‘suspect’ or ‘innocent’, ‘citizen’ or ‘foreigner’. Organized around three prominently figured bodies—the tortured body, the racialized body, and the veiled body—in the post-9/11 global landscape and its current “War on Terror”, this module examines the ways in which the body is situated and implicated in relations of power, sovereignty, identity, and violence.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-0-4-0-2-4","Prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","Preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening","Thursday Evening"]}]},{"ModuleCode":"USP3510","ModuleTitle":"Reason, Secularization & Multiculturalism","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module investigates three inter-connected questions: Can science prove that religion is irrational? When reason becomes so powerful that it dominates nature, what ethical problems will arise? Is reason or religious faith more suitable in providing a foundation for multiculturalism? These three questions, which are still much debated today, actually arose in the Age of Enlightenment, an 18th century intellectual movement so important that it shaped the modern West, and even, arguably, the East.

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given.
