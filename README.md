#README: UniLife Planner
=======================


##Overview
 
UniLife Planner serves as a compact and simple solution for NUS undergraduates in planning their courses throughout the 3 or 4 years. It aims to ensure that undergraduates do not miss out on modules they want and end up extending their term. Unlike other existing planners, we are planning to integrate social media such as Facebook into our web apps to unleash the power of collaborative information.

We are aiming for Project Gemini.

###1. Ideation

As NUS undergraduates, users has a busy lifestyle thus they wants the user interface to be as interactive and intuitive as possible. Using the apps would not be a hazzle.

As NUS is a big university and there are only certain selection of modules that are highly relevant to specific faculty and major, users want the apps to automatically narrow down the selection of modules to avoid confusion.

Users want to have a tailor-made graduation plan be it 3 years, 3.5 years, or 4 years.
 
Users want to see who else are planning to take the module at the specified semester. Topping it up with a social media invitation feature to get their peers to take the module would be awesome.
 
###2. Planned Features

During this sprint, PAFO is planning to finish the standard feature of the application. The advanced features and further testing will be done during the next sprint onward.
